[x] [Proxy.sol](https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/blob/main/Delegatecall/Delegatecall%20Source/Proxy.sol): The contract to interact with the upgradable contract.
[x] [Store.sol](https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/blob/main/Delegatecall/Delegatecall%20Source/Utils/Store.sol): The contract holding the storage variables.
[x] [Main.sol](https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/blob/main/Delegatecall/Delegatecall%20Source/Utils/Main.sol): The actual contract that handles the logic.
[ ] [Admin.sol](https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/blob/main/Delegatecall/Delegatecall%20Source/Utils/Admin.sol): Contract with admin roles. This is optional.
