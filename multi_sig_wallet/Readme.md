> - Multi - Sig - Wallet
https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/tree/main/multi_sig_wallet

This is also the second simple Solidity program that allows the transfer of value (ether) within tests accounts registered on the contract. An unregistered account cannot transfer or receive any ether. In the end, the transactions are pending until they are being confirmed by >1/2 of the total registered accounts in the contract.
