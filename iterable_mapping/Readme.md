> - Iterable Mapping
https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/tree/main/iterable_mapping

A project that simply takes the hashes of any complete transaction and adds it to an array, then maps the hash to the address that made the transaction. Hence, you can get the address of a particular hash by simply spotting their index on the array, then with the hash value at that index, grab the address.
