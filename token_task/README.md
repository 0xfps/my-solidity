Project overview:(TL:DR)

- Sorry for the late reply,
- It's quite simple actually. 
- I need a token with:
- 1,000,000,000 tokens

- Taxes:
- Should be able to be changed before/after deployment (7% altogether to start with)
- 1.5% USDT rewards
- 1.5% dev
- 1.5% marketing
- 1% liquidity 
- 1.5% environmental causes wallet

- They're taxes
- With each transaction, those percents will be taken
- The usdt rewards will go to everyone
- Dev tax will go to a dev wallet
- Marketing to Marketing wallet
- Liquidity tax will go to the Liquidity pool
