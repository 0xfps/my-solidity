> - Merkle Tree
https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/tree/main/merkle_tree

This program builds a merkle tree from the hashes of transactions done on the contract. Due to extreme high gas fees, the merkle tree is compiled from only the first 2 transactions.
The Description.md file in the repository (https://github.com/fps8k/my-solidity/blob/main/merkle_tree/Description.md) does more justice to the definition of the merkle tree and the algorithm behind it.
